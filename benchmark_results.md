## Optimization Strategy

### Three-Tier Classification System

1. **Small Arrays** (≤100 elements): Return full data
   - Maintains backward compatibility
   - Minimal token impact
   
2. **Medium Arrays** (101-10,000 elements): Return statistical summary
   - Dimensions and element count
   - Statistical measures (min, max, mean)
   - Sample data preview (5+ elements)
   - Memory usage information

3. **Large Arrays** (>10,000 elements): Return metadata only
   - Dimensions and element count  
   - Statistical measures (min, max, mean)
   - Minimal sample preview (3 elements)
   - Memory usage and compression note

### Configurable Thresholds

The system supports configurable compression levels:

**Aggressive Configuration:**
- Small threshold: 10 elements
- Medium threshold: 100 elements
- Preview elements: 2
- Result: 382 bytes for 40K element array

**Conservative Configuration:**
- Small threshold: 1,000 elements  
- Medium threshold: 50,000 elements
- Preview elements: 10
- Result: 506 bytes for 40K element array
